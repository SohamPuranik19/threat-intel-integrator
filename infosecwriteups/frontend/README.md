# Threat Intel Frontend

This is a Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS frontend shell for the Threat Intel integrator.

Getting started:

1. cd into the frontend folder
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

The frontend expects the Python backend to be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` for the `/lookup` endpoint.

Notes:
- This is a minimal scaffold. Filters, sorting and full table features will be implemented next.
